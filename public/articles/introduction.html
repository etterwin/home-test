                            SP (Senior Partner) brings 10%
                            MP (Master PArtner) brings 5%

                            discreditable pictures (Ex: with cigarettes, with the drunk people, in the shorts, swimsuit
                            or topless etc). Also, you’d better not demonstrate where and with whom you live and spend
                            your free time. People may get the wrong impression of you. They may think that you are not
                            interested enough in your work. If you want to share such content you’d better create the
                            private profile that would be available for your friends only. Always remember that leaders
                            have no weakness so you should delete all the information that somebody can use to
                            manipulate you. First of all, never give anyone a chance to take an inappropriate picture of
                            you. If you have taken on the role of leader you have no right to get drunk, behave
                            commonly, look rough etc. </p>

                        regular phone conversations. In this case clients feel your care and interest. Thus, you can
                        complete three tasks: fight against the competitors, giving the actual information on the
                        product/service and getting new clients due to the recommendations of your consumers.
                        Demonstration of care for your acting consumers is cheaper than searching for the new clients.
                        However, you need to consider some details. Remember that people get the impression when talking
                        to you on phone. The clients recognize your intonation, tone, quality of tone and pace of your
                        speech. Any pause in the phone conversation is more significant that the one in the real
                        conversation. Lack of confidence in your voice may create an impression that you are incompetent
                        in your work.</p>

                        satisfied with it. Compare them ironically with those who don’t use your services yet. This
                        method is often used by the maintenance companies. They say: “We will do the highly qualified
                        makeover fast!” and tell about someone who tried to do makeover by his own and as a result
                        wasted his money and time and even damaged the neighbors’ property. They show the pictures of
                        renovated and damaged facilities. One more method is showing the clients “before and after”
                        only. That is the method of the incomplete image. They don’t describe or demonstrate the middle
                        part of the whole story, so the process of using the product or the service is missing. That
                        gives an illusion of the problem’s immediate solution. Experts believe that this method is
                        typical but very effective at the same time. However, you need to know how to explain the
                        solution that gave your product/service. Otherwise it can damage your reputation.</p>

                        will unlikely be of the low quality – that’s the stereotype that helps create the impression of
                        the service’s high quality before buying it. Sometimes the price is almost the only criterion
                        upon which the consumer can estimate the quality of the product. These are some examples in
                        which people mention the price of the product hinting at its quality.</p>

                        a result give them what they’re waiting for. Such a pleasant bonus will evoke only positive
                        emotions. Just remember one thing: the customer must see a special attitude on your part toward
                        them in particular. After such a promise, the customer will surely keep coming back to you.</p>

                    you, they have healthy ambitions and large goals. They create their own structures and develop and

                    easily copy your actions and create their own teams. All of this is passed down the structure.</p>

                        likely, he or she will be using other brands as well, meanwhile boosting product revenue within
                        your distributor network.</p>

                        your company’s products if you weren’t going to be its partner and didn’t have to create monthly
                        assets? If the answer is “Yes”, then you’re on the right track!</p>

                        fact is that when a client starts telling you that it is expensive, he is trying to make you
                        believe that goods are the same for everyone, but you just have higher prices. Your task, using
                        the method "Let's compare", show a client that there are no identical things.</p>

                    But the absurdity of all this action is that 95% of words just remain that – words. If a goal or a
                    promise is not fulfilled, then this discredits the goal itself. If you’re not going to carry out a
                    promise, it’s better not to make it in the first place.</p>
                <p class="lesson-text--border">There exists a special technique called a “Declaration”. A Declaration is

                    paper and fill the air only with promises that you will definitely keep. A declaration is necessary
                    in the case that the new goal is a new frontier and a new height in your development. Very
                    important: a maximum of three declarations per year.</p>

                    not work without. This is the amount of money you’ll give someone if you don’t fulfill the goal and
                    how much you will give them if you do. For instance:</p>
                <p class="lesson-text--blue">Today, I have declared that I will buy an apartment in downtown Bangkok.
                    The value of my words is: 5,000 baht to the overseer if I don’t carry it out and 500 baht if I
                    do.</p>

                    yourself, but it’s harder to trick the other person. The overseer is a witness and guarantees that
                    your declaration is observed. You appoint the overseer. Place your signature under the declaration
                    of your serious intentions. Then, he places his, confirming that he takes your words seriously and
                    values them. In the cases that the circumstances are not brought to fruition, you will pay him the
                    value of your words. In case that you do fulfill it, then you also pay him, as we’ve already
                    said.</p>
                <p class="lesson-text">Who should the overseer be? The answer is simple – someone significant to you.
                    This is a person who you can’t let down. It’s a person who’s attitude and respect toward you is very
                    important.</p>

                <h2 class="lesson-caption--blue">Publicity</h2>
                <p class="lesson-text--border">You can easily get away with it if your declaration is stored in a drawer
                    of your table. But it will be much harder to do this if the declaration will be seen by people you
                    know. A website, blog, social network, or frequent kitchen conversations are all options for public
                    dissemination of your declaration.</p>
                <p class="lesson-text">Very few people have the guts and the gall to set big goals. But if a person does
                    this – he already deserves respect.</p>

                        properly, you won’t be able to get out of it. Also be prepared and understand that the goal will
                        be fulfilled if you make the decision to declare it.</p>

                <p class="lesson-text--border">One of such rules is the rule of 3 “yes”. It gives you more chances to

                    psychological feature of people: if a person repeatedly agrees, then the probability of a positive
                    response in the future is significantly increased. By the way, with the word "no" is exactly the
                    same story. To successfully complete the final stage of any transaction / sale, this rule works
                    perfectly well.</p>
